                      ==========================

REQUIREMENTS
============

This demo application provides a port for  the	MSP430	series	of  processors
from  Text  Instruments.   The	port  was  done  using	the  MSP430-P169  from
Olimex[1] which features a MSP430F169 MCU.
It requires a wired serial port to  a  host  processor	and  a	Modbus	Master
Software on the PC side  to  be  useful.   Demo  versions  of  Modbus  Masters
can be found in [2] and [3].

TESTING
=======

Start the Modbus Sample Application and test if the input  registers  starting
at protocol address 1000 can be read. There are four registers value available
and the output should look like:

Polling slave (Ctrl-C to stop) ...
[1000]: 6474
[1001]: 0
[1002]: 0
[1003]: 0
Polling slave (Ctrl-C to stop) ...
[1000]: -8831
[1001]: 0
[1002]: 0
[1003]: 0
Polling slave (Ctrl-C to stop) ...

The simple testing utility used in the 'demo_rtu.bat' script can be found
at [4].
