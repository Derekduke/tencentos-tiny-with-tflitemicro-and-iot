 * Interface for touchscreen driver which includes touchscreen calibration,
 * retrieving measurements etc.
 *
 * \par Usage
 *
 * -# Call TSD_Initialize() whenever the touchscreen should start the
 *    calibration process (as it is done in the function).
 * -# Declare a global TSD_PenPressed function anywhere in your code. This
 *    function will get called every time the pen is pressed on the screen.
 * -# Declare a global TSD_PenMoved function, which will get called whenever
 *    the pen stays in contact with the screen but changes position.
 * -# Declare a global TSD_PenReleased function, which will be invoked as the
 *    pen is lifted from the screen.
