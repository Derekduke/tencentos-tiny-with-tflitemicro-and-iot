/** \addtogroup wdt_module Working with WDT
 * The WDT driver provides the interface to configure and use the WDT
 * peripheral.
 * 
 * The WDT can be used to prevent system lock-up if the software becomes
 * trapped in a deadlock. It can generate a general reset or a processor
 * reset only. It is clocked by slow clock divided by 128.
 * 
 * The WDT is running at reset with 16 seconds watchdog period (slow clock at 32.768 kHz) 
 * and external reset generation enabled. The user must either disable it or
 * reprogram it to meet the application requires.
 *
 * To use the WDT, the user could follow these few steps:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Enable watchdog with given mode using \ref WDT_Enable().
 * <li>Restart the watchdog using \ref WDT_Restart() within the watchdog period.
 * </ul>
 *
 * For more accurate information, please look at the WDT section of the
 * Datasheet.
 *
 * \note 
 * The Watchdog Mode Register (WDT_MR) can be written only once.\n
