/// \dir
///
/// !!!Purpose
/// 
/// The utility directory contains several very small APIs for performing
/// specific tasks, such as LED configuration, BMP header decoding, etc.
///
/// !!!Contents
///
/// Most modules contained here are very small and do not fit in any of the
/// other at91lib categories. They primarily provide helper functions
/// (e.g. for handling BMP and WAV files) and re-implementation of libc code for
/// reducing code size (math, stdio, string).
///
/// Two important files are assert.h and trace.h. The first one provides macros
/// for run-time verifications of parameters & values. Trace.h enables the
/// programmer to add debug traces to APIs that can be easily turned on or off
/// depending on the debugging needs.
