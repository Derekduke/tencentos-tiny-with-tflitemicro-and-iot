 * \n
 * HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE FIRMWARE ?
 *
 * Download the "WM_W600.FLS" image
 *
 * This will download image which includes secboot & sdk into flash by ROM using xModem-protocol.
 * @code
 * Pulling down the bootmode pin and reset the device. Then UART0 will output: 
 * CCC...
 * For details,please refer to the sdk manual.
 * @endcode
 *
 * Download the "WM_W600_SEC.IMG" image
 *
 * This will download image which includes sdk by secboot using xmodem-protocol.
